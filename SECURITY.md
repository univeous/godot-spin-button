# Reporting Security Issues

The Godot Spin Button team takes security bugs in the project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email <mail@yudinikita.ru>. Our team will reply with the next steps in processing your message. After the initial response, our security team will update you on progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may request additional information or guidance if needed.

If you encounter security bugs in any third-party modules used in the Godot Spin Button project, please report them directly to the maintainers of those modules.
